 **To be clear, you do not need all 3, I will explain what you do/dont need to do for each of them if you dont want to do all of them.**
 
1. Grab a Micro SD card if youre using a Pi2/Pi3.(You can skip this if youve already freshly installed Raspian/NOOBS). If its over 32GB, use a formating utility like GUIFormat, if the SD card is less than 32GB, windows can format it.
Select FAT32, and make sure nothing is on the card before you format it. 

2. [Download the OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) 
*I reccomend using the Lite varient for this project but the Desktop version will work if you want a GUI.*
If you choose NOOBS (ez Raspian Installer), you cant use PiBakery
If you choose the .ISO/.IMG of Raspian, you can download PiBakery and use it [Here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/).

I reccommend enabling at the very least SSH, changing your keyboard (the GB one is different than the US one),
